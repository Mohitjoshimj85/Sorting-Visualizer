# Sorting Visualization

This project provides a web-based visualization of various sorting algorithms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can interact with the webpage to generate arrays of random heights, select the size of the array, and choose from different sorting algorithms to visualize their sorting process step by step.

## Features

- Generate arrays of random heights based on user-defined size.
- Visualize sorting algorithms including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
- Interactive visualization with real-time updates of array elements.
- User-friendly interface with easy navigation and controls.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualization.git](https://github.com/Mohitjoshimj85/Sorting-Visualizer.git)
   

2. Open the project directory in your code editor.

3. Open the `sort.html` file in your web browser to view the sorting visualization webpage.

4. Interact with the controls to generate arrays, select sorting algorithms, and visualize their sorting process.

## Usage

- Use the input field to specify the size of the array or keep the default value.
- Click the "Regenerate" button to generate a new array based on the specified size.
- Click on the sorting algorithm buttons to visualize their sorting process on the generated array.
